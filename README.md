# Photo Album React Project

## To install

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install`

## To start the project locally

- Run `npm start`
- Go to `https://localhost:3000` in your browser of choice and accept the certificate
- Alternatively, your terminal will give you the network address for the project which you can use to access the app with a device on the ame network (e.g. for mobile testing)

## Given more time, I would add:

- A Toast to let the user know the CRUD actions have been completed or the data fetch failed
- A mobile layout where the side panel slides in and out
- The ability to rename the albums and photos
- Better input validation
- Drag and drop for moving photos to albums
- Better animations (especially when opening and closing the modal)
